# Welcome to SciCat Users Manual

This is a short guide to most common questions users of SciCat can face. First of all: What is SciCat? And why should I use it? SciCat, a _science catalogue_, should serve you to find back your data. SciCat is a bookkeeping tool accompanying some critical steps during the entire data life cycle which are: getting an *overview of datasets* for data analysis, for re-analysis, for publishing datasets, and in particular for publication. In SciCat, only the meta data is stored, descriptions to identify a certain measurements.

We highlight most promiment features that SciCat offers, but note that SciCat is a general software layer which when integrated with site-specific application develops its full potential.

## Features: quick links to How-To's

Your data may be of type raw or derived, you may want to login or just browse what's in the catalogue. Here is how to find more on how to proceed:

* [Login](login/index.md)
* Search and find your data, see [Datasets How to query](datasets/index.md#how-to-query-datasets)
*   How to change some fields after ingestion
*   How to view history of changes to a dataset
*   How to group and tag datasets
*   How to group and tag grouped datasets


## Structure of SciCat

These main classes determine the functionality of SciCat: 

1. [Datasets](datasets/index.md): This class is the most elaborated one. 
2. [Proposals](proposals.md): are used to link datasets to the proposal under which beamtime was granted.
3. [Instruments](instruments.md): Depending on the science background `instruments` can mean something different.
4. [Samples](samples.md):
