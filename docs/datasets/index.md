# Datasets
Datasets can include several files which e.g. comprise a self-contained measurement - which is fully customizeable during ingestion of meta data. Users can search, view, list the meta data. Soon the feature to group and tag them will be available. Datasets can also be issued to be published: either removing the restricted view or triggering the process of obtaining a DOI for the selected datasets, see [old description](Publishing.md).
