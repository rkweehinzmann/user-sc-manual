# User Manual

The User Manual summarizes the main functionality of the SciCat Web application by showing screenshot examples for all the parts of the application.

In the following the concept of a **dataset** is of central importance. SciCat stores information about datasets, i.e. a collection of files, rather than single files. The persons responsible for adding new data to the data catalog do this, by defining these sets of files and jointly *ingesting* them to the system.

Please note that the data catalog does **not** store the file contents itself. It just stores the metadata , i.e. semantic information which is useful to understand the contents of the files contained in the dataset and the list of the filenames, their sizes etc.

The datasets can contain **raw** data , e.g. data coming from a measurement device or instrument and also **derived** data, which is data derived (calculated) from the raw data.
