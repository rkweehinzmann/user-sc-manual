First of all: What is SciCat? And why should I use it? SciCat, a science catalogue, should serve you to find back your data. SciCat is a bookkeeping tool accompanying some critical steps during the entire data life cycle which are: getting an overview of datasets for data analysis, for re-analysis, for publishing datasets, and in particular for publication. In SciCat, only the meta data is stored, descriptions to identify a certain measurements.</p> <p>We highlight most promiment features that SciCat offers, but note that SciCat is a general software layer which when integrated with site-specific application develops its full potential.</p>"},{"location":"#features-quick-links-to-how-tos","title":"Features: quick links to How-To's","text":"<p>Your data may be of type raw or derived, you may want to login or just browse what's in the catalogue.

This step can be repeated to add further datasets. Once the selection is finished you open the Cart ( click on the Cart symbol and choose actions ) to see the selected datasets:</p> <p></p> <p>Here you can still change your selection, remove datasets etc. Once this is finished simply hit the publish button. This leads you to the following screen:</p> <p></p> <p>Some of these fields will be pre-filled with information derived from the proposal data, such as the abstract. Independent of the pre-filling you can change the contents as you like until you are satisfied. Then hit the publish button, which leads you to the resulting display page:</p> <p></p> <p>Initially the status field is in state \"pending\". This means, the published data information has been stored, but not yet made public to the worldwide DOI system, and no landing page has been created yet.

You are able to log in to the system using the same credentials you use on that account. This process is called authenitication in IT tech terminology</p> <p>When you login as a user your user management system will assign groups to the logged in user. Each dataset is also assigned to one such group (via the so called ownerGroup field), and you can view the datasets only, if you are member of the corresponding group.
