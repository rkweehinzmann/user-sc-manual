First of all: What is SciCat? And why should I use it? SciCat, a science catalogue, should serve you to find back your data. SciCat is a bookkeeping tool accompanying some critical steps during the entire data life cycle which are: getting an overview of datasets for data analysis, for re-analysis, for publishing datasets, and in particular for publication. In SciCat, only the meta data is stored, descriptions to identify a certain measurements.</p> <p>We highlight most promiment features that SciCat offers, but note that SciCat is a general software layer which when integrated with site-specific application develops its full potential.</p>"},{"location":"#features-quick-links-to-how-tos","title":"Features: quick links to How-To's","text":"<p>Your data may be of type raw or derived, you may want to login or just browse what's in the catalogue.
